                        Students will learn how to use many different languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for both front-end 
                        and back-end development. They can organize their assignments and thoughts in Jupyter notebook, which is basically 
                        a blog site.

                        Collaboration is important in any field, especially in Computer Science where you need to work with many people who may have
                        different ideas and thoughts than your own. Through collaboration the team ensures that there is diversity in the project. 
                        Which makes it both better for the user and the team itself.
